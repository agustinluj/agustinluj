👨‍💻 Data Geek | 🧠 ML Noob | 📊 Turning Data into Stories
Welcome to my code-hacking lab! I'm a Jr. Data Scientist passionate about turning messy data into insights and models that (almost always) work.

💡 When not debugging, I’m learning more about stats, data viz, or ML trends.

🔧 Tools I’m rocking:
# Python
tools = {'scikit-learn', 'pandas', 'numpy', 'xgboost', ...}
# SQL
sql_tool = 'for taming chaos'
# Visualizations
visualizations = ['matplotlib', 'seaborn', 'Power BI', 'Tableau', 'mishmash of this and that']

😂 My work motto:
“Data science is 90% cleaning data... and the other 10% wishing someone had already done it for you.”

🚀 What I’m working on now:

projects = [
    'Improving neural networks & predictive models',
    'Contributing to open-source projects',
    'Chasing the almost-perfect model (Yeah, I know)'
]

📬 Let’s chat! Into data science, AI, or tech memes? I’m all ears!
Data science never sleeps, but I do (sometimes)! 😴
