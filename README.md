## Hi there 👋 (let's keep this, ha!)

👨‍💻 Data Geek | 🧠 ML Noob | 📊 Turning Data into Stories

Welcome to my number-crunching, code-hacking lab. I’m a Jr. Data Scientist who loves turning messy data into insights and models that (almost always) work.

💡 What am I up to?
I dive into datasets, train models, and occasionally battle Python errors at 2 a.m. When I’m not debugging, I’m probably learning something new about stats, data viz, or ML trends.

🔧 Tools I’m rocking:

🐍 Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, xgboost etc.)
📊 SQL (for when I need to tame the chaos)
📉 Visualizations with matplotlib, seaborn, and a touch of magic... we can add also Power BI and Tableau, a mishmash of this and that...

😂 My work motto:
“Data science is 90% cleaning data... and the other 10% wishing someone had already done it for you.”

🚀 Let's be serious, what I’m working on now:

Getting better at neural networks and predictive models
Contributing to some cool open-source projects
Chasing the almost-perfect model (yeah, I know)

📬 Let’s chat! If you’re into data science, AI, or just want to share a good tech meme, I’m all ears!

Data science never sleeps, but I do (sometimes)! 😴
