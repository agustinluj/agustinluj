## 👨‍💻 Data Geek | 🧠 ML Noob | 📊 Turning Data into Stories

Welcome to my code-hacking lab! I'm a Jr Data Scientist passionate about turning messy data into insights and models that (almost always) work.

💡 What am I up to?
I dive into datasets, train models, and sometimes fight Python errors at 2 a.m. When not debugging, I’m learning more about stats, data viz, or ML trends.

🔧 Tools I’m rocking:
🐍 Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, xgboost, etc)
📊 SQL (for taming chaos)
📉 Visualizations with matplotlib, seaborn, Power BI, Tableau... a mishmash of this and that.

😂 My work motto:
“Data science is 90% cleaning data... and the other 10% wishing someone had already done it for you.”

🚀 What I’m working on now:
Improving at neural networks and predictive models
Contributing to open-source projects
Chasing the almost-perfect model (Yeah, I know)

📬 Let’s chat! Into data science, AI, or tech memes? I’m all ears!
Data science never sleeps, but I do (sometimes)! 😴
